# Simulated Line Following Robot Using PID Controllers with Webots and Python


<h2>
The bot is having 3 LEDs on its upper surface in one line (left to right, when seeing from rear to front in top view)</h2>


<h2>Tasks</h2>

<h3>A) Line Following:</h3>
<p>The bot traverses a black track with a white strip present in the middle, as to reach the 1st checkpoint.</p>
<h3>B) Edge Following:</h3>
<p>The bot follows an edge that will be dividing the tracks into two interchangeable halves (black & white).</p>
<h3>C) Junction detection:</h3>
<p>The bot starts following the white line again, and all the LEDs on the bot glow when any junction is detected. The junction is a white line extended on both sides. The system also keeps a count of the number of junctions that it encounters along the way.</p>
<h3>D) Obstacle Counting:</h3>
<p>The bot continues following the central line. On top of that, the number of obstacles/wall blocks placed on either side of the track are detected correctly. If the block is present on the left side of the track, then the left LED glows when the bot passes through the block. Similarly, if the block is present on the right side of the track, the right LED glows. In case obstacles are present on both sides simultaneously at a point, then both the left and the right LEDs glow (not middle). The end of this track completes checkpoint-4 and is demarcated by a black square platform and dead-end/ look ahead straight obstacle at the end of the track.</p>
<h3>E) Wall Following:</h3>
<p>The bot travels by maintaining a safe distance of 5-15 cm from the wall.</p>
